# Q-and-A Chat Bot from PDF

This chat bot is designed to answer queries from a PDF file that you upload. Leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques, this project utilizes BERT and Transformer models to comprehend and respond to questions efficiently. The user interface is enhanced for better user experience through Gradio, ensuring a seamless interaction process.

## Features

- **PDF Query Handling:**
  Upload your PDF file, and the chat bot will extract relevant information to answer your questions accurately.

- **State-of-the-Art Models:**
  The project incorporates BERT and Transformer models, leading advancements in natural language processing, to understand the context and provide precise responses.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  The UI is powered by Gradio, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing experience for users interacting with the chat bot.

## Model Training

Due to computational resource limitations, the models were trained partially, focusing on the first 15 questions and answers. While not exhaustive, these trained sections showcase the bot's capabilities and provide a foundation for future improvements.
